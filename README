Living Colors Remote Control Library (licor)
============================================

An easy-to-use high level API to control the first generation of Philips Living
Colors lamps.

It relies on the CC2500 2.4 GHz transceiver by Texas Instruments and thus needs
an SPI device or four GPIO pins to make connection to it. There are a couple of
driver implementations for the SPI cores of various MCUs already available
(MSP430, CC3200, Linux' spidev driver) and a soft SPI implementation, that only
needs to be adjusted to the GPIO at hand, as well. (Coming soon – after a code
cleanup – actually.)

**Please note** that this is still a work in progress and e.g. the address
learning functionality is not yet implemented.
